# Business-Lead-Scoring
A Machine Learning Project
Lead scoring is a business strategy employed to assess the value of potential customers, commonly referred to as 'leads.' This involves scrutinizing customer behavior and their responses across various marketing channels. Traditionally, this assessment was conducted manually; however, contemporary trends underscore the substantial advantages of integrating Machine Learning in the realms of Business and Marketing. The automation of the lead scoring process can be achieved to a significant extent through machine learning. The aim of this project is to develop a Machine Learning Model designed to process specific customer data, in this case, from a bank, analyze the patterns evident in the data, and make conclusions regarding the worthiness of a customer, essentially assigning a 'score' to the 'lead.'
